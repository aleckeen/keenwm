# keenwm

keenwm is a tiling window manager. It uses xmonad as a dependency. It is pretty much a wrapper
around xmonad. You might be asking why I decided to write something like that. The answer is
that I want to learn Haskell and I thought writing this would be a great way to start. I
learnt a lot doing it. Although I have plans to eventually write the core of the wm on my own
I don't think I will ever do that.
